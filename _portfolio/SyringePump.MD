# 3D Printed Syringe Pump
While syringe pumps have been around for quite a long time, the first ones are fairly unrecognizable as the same product as the ones we see today. The syringe pump was originally invented by Christopher Wren in 1656 out of a writing quill and a pig’s bladder. While this is admittedly much cooler than a stepper motor, it was found to be largely ineffective for many reasons. It wasn’t until 300 years later that Dr. Christopher D.W. Haning reinvented the concept as a means for delivering precise amounts of medication. Since then, syringe pumps have become a commonplace medical technology, yet they’ve remained very expensive. The syringe pump described here demonstrates that such a device can be constructed at a reasonable cost.
